Power BI Personal Projects and Freelancing Projects
I worked as a Free Lancer for companies and created all the reports.

1. HR Budget - This report focused on expenses and budgeting and helped the company to track their expenses. I used various DAX functions to calculate the metrics and ensured accurate data.

2. Manpower Report - This report had the statistics of the employee count of the company. I created various measures and calculations with DAX and analyzed the growth percentage year on year and discoverd some trends based on the analysis of the report.

3. PI Report - Production Incentive Report was created to keep a track of the production department and help them to monitor and track their metrics.

4. Sales Report - Performed a thorough analysis of sales data where I calculated year on year growth rate of the company, vendor metrics, cost metrics and the profit metrics. This report also analyzed the team's performance for the over the course of 3 years. I also created a ranking system based on different metrics for the vendors and then used Rank function in Power BI to assign rankings to the vendors.
